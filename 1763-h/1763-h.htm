      Richard Herrick was a young man with a gentle disposition, much money, and
      no sense of humor. His object in life was to marry Miss Catherweight. For
      three years she had tried to persuade him this could not be, and finally,
      in order to convince him, married some one else. When the woman he loves
      marries another man, the rejected one is popularly supposed to take to
      drink or to foreign travel. Statistics show that, instead, he instantly
      falls in love with the best friend of the girl who refused him. But, as
      Herrick truly loved Miss Catherweight, he could not worship any other
      woman, and so he became a lover of nature. Nature, he assured his men
      friends, does not disappoint you. The more thought, care, affection you
      give to nature, the more she gives you in return, and while, so he
      admitted, in wooing nature there are no great moments, there are no
      heart-aches. Jackson, one of the men friends, and of a frivolous
      disposition, said that he also could admire a landscape, but he would
      rather look at the beautiful eyes of a girl he knew than at the Lakes of
      Killarney, with a full moon, a setting sun, and the aurora borealis for a
      background. Herrick suggested that, while the beautiful eyes might seek
      those of another man, the Lakes of Killarney would always remain where you
      could find them. Herrick pursued his new love in Connecticut on an
      abandoned farm which he converted into a &ldquo;model&rdquo; one. On it he established
      model dairies and model incubators. He laid out old-fashioned gardens,
      sunken gardens, Italian gardens, landscape gardens, and a game preserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game preserve was his own especial care and pleasure. It consisted of
      two hundred acres of dense forest and hills and ridges of rock. It was
      filled with mysterious caves, deep chasms, tiny gurgling streams, nestling
      springs, and wild laurel. It was barricaded with fallen tree-trunks and
      moss-covered rocks that had never felt the foot of man since that foot had
      worn a moccasin. Around the preserve was a high fence stout enough to keep
      poachers on the outside and to persuade the wild animals that inhabited it
      to linger on the inside. These wild animals were squirrels, rabbits, and
      raccoons. Every day, in sunshine or in rain, entering through a private
      gate, Herrick would explore this holy of holies. For such vermin as would
      destroy the gentler animals he carried a gun. But it was turned only on
      those that preyed upon his favorites. For hours he would climb through
      this wilderness, or, seated on a rock, watch a bluebird building her nest
      or a squirrel laying in rations against the coming of the snow. In time he
      grew to think he knew and understood the inhabitants of this wild place of
      which he was the overlord. He looked upon them not as his tenants but as
      his guests. And when they fled from him in terror to caves and hollow
      tree-trunks, he wished he might call them back and explain he was their
      friend, that it was due to him they lived in peace. He was glad they were
      happy. He was glad it was through him that, undisturbed, they could live
      the simple life.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fall came through ambition. Herrick himself attributed it to his too
      great devotion to nature and nature&rsquo;s children. Jackson, he of the
      frivolous mind, attributed it to the fact that any man is sure to come to
      grief who turns from the worship of God&rsquo;s noblest handiwork, by which
      Jackson meant woman, to worship chipmunks and Plymouth Rock hens. One
      night Jackson lured Herrick into New York to a dinner and a music hall. He
      invited also one Kelly, a mutual friend of a cynical and combative
      disposition. Jackson liked to hear him and Herrick abuse each other, and
      always introduced subjects he knew would cause each to lose his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on this night, Herrick needed no goading. He was in an ungrateful
      mood. Accustomed to food fresh from the soil and the farmyard, he sneered
      at hothouse asparagus, hothouse grapes, and cold-storage quail. At the
      music hall he was even more difficult. In front of him sat a stout lady
      who when she shook with laughter shed patchouli and a man who smoked
      American cigarettes. At these and the steam heat, the nostrils of Herrick,
      trained to the odor of balsam and the smoke of open wood fires, took
      offense. He refused to be amused. The monologue artist, in whom Jackson
      found delight, caused Herrick only to groan; the knockabout comedians he
      hoped would break their collar-bones; the lady who danced Salome, and who
      fascinated Kelly, Herrick prayed would catch pneumonia and die of it. And
      when the drop rose upon the Countess Zichy&rsquo;s bears, his dissatisfaction
      reached a climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three bears&mdash;a large papa bear, a mamma bear, and the baby
      bear. On the programme they were described as Bruno, Clara, and Ikey. They
      were of a dusty brown, with long, curling noses tipped with white, and
      fat, tan-colored bellies. When father Bruno, on his hind legs and bare
      feet, waddled down the stage, he resembled a Hebrew gentleman in a brown
      bathing suit who had lost his waist-line. As he tripped doubtfully
      forward, with mincing steps, he continually and mournfully wagged his
      head. He seemed to be saying: &ldquo;This water is much too cold for me.&rdquo; The
      mamma bear was dressed in a poke bonnet and white apron, and resembled the
      wolf who frightened Little Red Riding-Hood, and Ikey, the baby bear, wore
      rakishly over one eye the pointed cap of a clown. To those who knew their
      vaudeville, this was indisputable evidence that Ikey would furnish the
      comic relief. Nor did Ikey disappoint them. He was a wayward son. When his
      parents were laboriously engaged in a boxing-match, or dancing to the
      &ldquo;Merry Widow Waltz,&rdquo; or balancing on step-ladders, Ikey, on all fours,
      would scamper to the foot-lights and, leaning over, make a swift grab at
      the head of the first trombone. And when the Countess Zichy, apprised by
      the shouts of the audience of Ikey&rsquo;s misconduct, waved a toy whip, Ikey
      would gallop back to his pedestal and howl at her. To every one, except
      Herrick and the first trombone, this playfulness on the part of Ikey
      furnished great delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The performances of the bears ended with Bruno and Clara dancing heavily
      to the refrain of the &ldquo;Merry Widow Waltz,&rdquo; while Ikey pretended to conduct
      the music of the orchestra. On the final call, Madame Zichy threw to each
      of the animals a beer bottle filled with milk; and the gusto with which
      the savage-looking beasts uncorked the bottles and drank from them greatly
      amused the audience. Ikey, standing on his hind legs, his head thrown
      back, with both paws clasping the base of the bottle, shoved the neck far
      down his throat, and then, hurling it from him, and cocking his clown&rsquo;s
      hat over his eyes, gave a masterful imitation of a very intoxicated bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; exclaimed Herrick hotly, &ldquo;is a degrading spectacle. It degrades
      the bear and degrades me and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it bores me,&rdquo; said Kelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you understood nature,&rdquo; retorted Herrick, &ldquo;and nature&rsquo;s children, it
      would infuriate you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go to a music hall to get infuriated,&rdquo; said Kelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trained dogs I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; exclaimed Herrick. &ldquo;Dogs are not wild
      animals. The things they&rsquo;re trained to do are of USE. They can guard the
      house, or herd sheep. But a bear is a wild beast. Always will be a wild
      beast. You can&rsquo;t train him to be of use. It&rsquo;s degrading to make him ride a
      bicycle. I hate it! If I&rsquo;d known there were to be performing bears
      to-night, I wouldn&rsquo;t have come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I&rsquo;d known you were to be here to-night, I wouldn&rsquo;t have come!&rdquo;
       said Kelly. &ldquo;Where do we go to next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went next to a restaurant in a gayly decorated cellar. Into this
      young men like themselves and beautiful ladies were so anxious to hurl
      themselves that to restrain them a rope was swung across the entrance and
      page boys stood on guard. When a young man became too anxious to spend his
      money, the page boys pushed in his shirt front. After they had fought
      their way to a table, Herrick ungraciously remarked he would prefer to sup
      in a subway station. The people, he pointed out, would be more human, the
      decorations were much of the same Turkish-bath school of art, and the air
      was no worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, Clarence!&rdquo; begged Jackson, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll soon be dead. To-morrow
      you&rsquo;ll be back among your tree-toads and sunsets. And, let us hope,&rdquo; he
      sighed, &ldquo;no one will try to stop you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What worries me is this,&rdquo; explained Herrick. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking that,
      if one night of this artificial life is so hard upon me, what must it be
      to those bears!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kelly exclaimed, with exasperation: &ldquo;Confound the bears!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If
      you must spoil my supper weeping over animals, weep over cart-horses. They
      work. Those bears are loafers. They&rsquo;re as well fed as pet canaries.
      They&rsquo;re aristocrats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not a free life!&rdquo; protested Herrick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the life they
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a darned sight better,&rdquo; declared Kelly, &ldquo;than sleeping in a damp
      wood, eating raw blackberries&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more you say,&rdquo; retorted Herrick, &ldquo;the more you show you know nothing
      whatsoever of nature&rsquo;s children and their habits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all you know of them,&rdquo; returned Kelly, &ldquo;is that a cat has nine lives,
      and a barking dog won&rsquo;t bite. You&rsquo;re a nature faker.&rdquo; Herrick refused to
      be diverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hurt me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They were so big, and good-natured, and helpless.
      I&rsquo;ll bet that woman beats them! I kept thinking of them as they were in
      the woods, tramping over the clean pine needles, eating nuts, and&mdash;and
      honey, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buns!&rdquo; suggested Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forget them,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to haunt me, to-morrow,
      when I&rsquo;m back in the woods; I&rsquo;ll think of those poor beasts capering in a
      hot theatre, when they ought to be out in the open as God meant they&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; protested Kelly, &ldquo;take &lsquo;em to the open. And turn &lsquo;em loose!
      And I hope they bite YOU!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Herrick frowned so deeply that Kelly feared he had gone too far.
      Inwardly, he reproved himself for not remembering that his friend lacked a
      sense of humor. But Herrick undeceived him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;To-morrow I will buy those bears, take
      them to the farm, and turn them loose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No objections his friend could offer could divert him from his purpose.
      When they urged that to spend so much money in such a manner was
      criminally wasteful, he pointed out that he was sufficiently rich to
      indulge any extravagant fancy, whether in polo ponies or bears; when they
      warned him that if he did not look out the bears would catch him alone in
      the woods, and eat him, he retorted that the bears were now educated to a
      different diet; when they said he should consider the peace of mind of his
      neighbors, he assured them the fence around his game preserve would
      restrain an elephant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; protested Kelly, &ldquo;what you propose to do is not only
      impracticable, but it&rsquo;s cruelty to animals. A domesticated animal can&rsquo;t
      return to a state of nature, and live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; jeered Herrick. &ldquo;Did you ever read &lsquo;The Call of the Wild&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever read,&rdquo; retorted Kelly, &ldquo;what happened at the siege of
      Ladysmith when the oats ran low and they drove the artillery horses out to
      grass? They starved, that&rsquo;s all. And if you don&rsquo;t feed your bears on milk
      out of a bottle they&rsquo;ll starve too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what will happen,&rdquo; cried Jackson; &ldquo;those bears have forgotten what
      a pine forest smells like. Maybe it&rsquo;s a pity, but it&rsquo;s the fact. I&rsquo;ll bet
      if you could ask them whether they&rsquo;d rather sleep in a cave on your farm
      or be headliners in vaudeville, they&rsquo;d tell you they were &lsquo;devoted to
      their art.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed Kelly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re so far from nature that if they didn&rsquo;t
      have that colored boy to comb and brush them twice a day they&rsquo;d be ashamed
      to look each other in the eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; continued Jackson, &ldquo;trained animals love to &lsquo;show
      off.&rsquo; They&rsquo;re children. Those bears ENJOY doing those tricks. They ENJOY
      the applause. They enjoy dancing to the &lsquo;Merry Widow Waltz.&rsquo; And if you
      lock them up in your jungle, they&rsquo;ll get so homesick that they&rsquo;ll give a
      performance twice a day to the squirrels and woodpeckers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as hard to unlearn a thing as to learn it,&rdquo; said Kelly
      sententiously. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make a man who has learned to wear shoes enjoy
      going around in his bare feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; cried Herrick. &ldquo;Look at me. Didn&rsquo;t I love New York? I loved it so I
      never went to bed for fear I&rsquo;d miss something. But when I went &lsquo;Back to
      the Land,&rsquo; did it take me long to fall in love with the forests and the
      green fields? It took me a week. I go to bed now the same day I get up,
      and I&rsquo;ve passed on my high hat and frock coat to a scarecrow. And I&rsquo;ll bet
      you when those bears once scent the wild woods they&rsquo;ll stampede for them
      like Croker going to a third alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I repeat,&rdquo; cried Kelly, &ldquo;you are a nature faker. And I&rsquo;ll leave it to
      the bears to prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have done our best,&rdquo; sighed Jackson. &ldquo;We have tried to save him money
      and trouble. And now all he can do for us in return is to give us seats
      for the opening performance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What the bears cost Herrick he never told. But it was a very large sum. As
      the Countess Zichy pointed out, bears as bears, in a state of nature, are
      cheap. If it were just a bear he wanted, he himself could go to Pike
      County, Pennsylvania, and trap one. What he was paying for, she explained,
      was the time she had spent in educating the Bruno family, and added to
      that the time during which she must now remain idle while she educated
      another family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick knew for what he was paying. It was the pleasure of rescuing
      unwilling slaves from bondage. As to their expensive education, if they
      returned to a state of ignorance as rapidly as did most college graduates
      he knew, he would be satisfied. Two days later, when her engagement at the
      music hall closed, Madame Zichy reluctantly turned over her pets to their
      new manager. With Ikey she was especially loath to part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never get one like him,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;Ikey is the funniest
      four-legged clown in America. He&rsquo;s a natural-born comedian. Folks think I
      learn him those tricks, but it&rsquo;s all his own stuff. Only last week we was
      playing Paoli&rsquo;s in Bridgeport, and when I was putting Bruno through the
      hoops, Ikey runs to the stage-box and grabs a pound of caramels out of a
      girl&rsquo;s lap-and swallows the box. And in St. Paul, if the trombone hadn&rsquo;t
      worn a wig, Ikey would have scalped him. Say, it was a scream! When the
      audience see the trombone snatched bald-headed, and him trying to get back
      his wig, and Ikey chewing it, they went crazy. You can&rsquo;t learn a bear
      tricks like that. It&rsquo;s just genius. Some folks think I taught him to act
      like he was intoxicated, but he picked that up, too, all by himself,
      through watching my husband. And Ikey&rsquo;s very fond of beer on his own
      account. If I don&rsquo;t stop them, the stage hands would be always slipping
      him drinks. I hope you won&rsquo;t give him none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not!&rdquo; said Herrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bears, Ikey in one cage and Bruno and Clara in another, travelled by
      express to the station nearest the Herrick estate. There they were
      transferred to a farm wagon, and grumbling and growling, and with Ikey
      howling like an unspanked child, they were conveyed to the game preserve.
      At the only gate that entered it, Kelly and Jackson and a specially
      invited house party of youths and maidens were gathered to receive them.
      At a greater distance stood all of the servants and farm hands, and as the
      wagon backed against the gate, with the door of Ikey&rsquo;s cage opening
      against it, the entire audience, with one accord, moved solidly to the
      rear. Herrick, with a pleased but somewhat nervous smile, mounted the
      wagon. But before he could unlock the cage Kelly demanded to be heard. He
      insisted that, following the custom of all great artists, the bears should
      give a farewell performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He begged that Bruno and Clara might be permitted to dance together. He
      pointed out that this would be the last time they could listen to the
      strains of the &ldquo;Merry Widow Waltz.&rdquo; He called upon everybody present to
      whistle it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion of an open-air performance was received coldly. At the
      moment no one seemed able to pucker his lips into a whistle, and some even
      explained that with that famous waltz they were unfamiliar.
    </p>
    <p>
      One girl attained an instant popularity by pointing out that the bears
      could waltz just as well on one side of the fence as the other. Kelly,
      cheated of his free performance, then begged that before Herrick condemned
      the bears to starve on acorns, he should give them a farewell drink, and
      Herrick, who was slightly rattled, replied excitedly that he had not
      ransomed the animals only to degrade them. The argument was interrupted by
      the French chef falling out of a tree. He had climbed it, he explained, in
      order to obtain a better view.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, in turn, it was explained to him that a bear also could climb a
      tree, he remembered he had left his oven door open. His departure reminded
      other servants of duties they had neglected, and one of the guests, also,
      on remembering he had put in a long-distance call, hastened to the house.
      Jackson suggested that perhaps they had better all return with him, as the
      presence of so many people might frighten the bears. At the moment he
      spoke, Ikey emitted a hideous howl, whether of joy or rage no one knew,
      and few remained to find out. It was not until Herrick had investigated
      and reported that Ikey was still behind the bars that the house party
      cautiously returned. The house party then filed a vigorous protest. Its
      members, with Jackson as spokesman, complained that Herrick was relying
      entirely too much on his supposition that the bears would be anxious to
      enter the forest. Jackson pointed out that, should they not care to do so,
      there was nothing to prevent them from doubling back under the wagon; in
      which case the house party and all of the United States lay before them.
      It was not until a lawn-tennis net and much chicken wire was stretched in
      intricate thicknesses across the lower half of the gate that Herrick was
      allowed to proceed. Unassisted, he slid back the cage door, and without a
      moment&rsquo;s hesitation Ikey leaped from the wagon through the gate and into
      the preserve. For an instant, dazed by the sudden sunlight, he remained
      motionless, and then, after sniffing delightedly at the air, stuck his
      nose deep into the autumn leaves. Turning on his back, he luxuriously and
      joyfully kicked his legs, and rolled from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick gave a shout of joy and triumph. &ldquo;What did I tell you!&rdquo; he called.
      &ldquo;See how he loves it! See how happy he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; protested Kelly. &ldquo;He thought you gave him the sign to &lsquo;roll
      over.&rsquo; Tell him to &lsquo;play dead,&rsquo; and he&rsquo;ll do that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell ALL the bears to
      &lsquo;play dead,&rsquo;&rdquo; begged Jackson, &ldquo;until I&rsquo;m back in the billiard-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flushed with happiness, Herrick tossed Ikey&rsquo;s cage out of the wagon, and
      opened the door of the one that held Bruno and Clara. On their part, there
      was a moment of doubt. As though suspecting a trap, they moved to the edge
      of the cage, and gazed critically at the screen of trees and tangled vines
      that rose before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They think it&rsquo;s a new backdrop,&rdquo; explained Kelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the delight with which Ikey was enjoying his bath in the autumn leaves
      was not lost upon his parents. Slowly and clumsily they dropped to the
      ground. As though they expected to be recalled, each turned to look at the
      group of people who had now run to peer through the wire meshes of the
      fence. But, as no one spoke and no one signalled, the three bears, in
      single file, started toward the edge of the forest. They had of cleared
      space to cover only a little distance, and at each step, as though fearful
      they would be stopped and punished, one or the other turned his head. But
      no one halted them. With quickening footsteps the bears, now almost at a
      gallop, plunged forward. The next instant they were lost to sight, and
      only the crackling of the underbrush told that they had come into their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick dropped to the ground and locked himself inside the preserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going after them,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;to see what they&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a frantic chorus of entreaties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass!&rdquo; begged Jackson. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll eat you.&rdquo; Herrick waved his
      hand reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t even see me,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I can find my way about this
      place better than they can. And I&rsquo;ll keep to windward of them, and watch
      them. Go to the house,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in an hour, and
      report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with real relief that, on assembling for dinner, the house party
      found Herrick, in high spirits, with the usual number of limbs, and
      awaiting them. The experiment had proved a great success. He told how,
      unheeded by the bears, he had, without difficulty, followed in their
      tracks. For an hour he had watched them. No happy school-children, let
      loose at recess, could have embraced their freedom with more obvious
      delight. They drank from the running streams, for honey they explored the
      hollow tree-trunks, they sharpened their claws on moss-grown rocks, and
      among the fallen oak leaves scratched violently for acorns. So satisfied
      was Herrick with what he had seen, with the success of his experiment, and
      so genuine and unselfish was he in the thought of the happiness he had
      brought to the beasts of the forests, that for him no dinner ever passed
      more pleasantly. Miss Waring, who sat next to her host, thought she had
      seldom met a man with so kind and simple a nature. She rather resented the
      fact, and she was inwardly indignant that so much right feeling and
      affection could be wasted on farmyard fowls, and four-footed animals. She
      felt sure that some nice girl, seated at the other end of the table,
      smiling through the light of the wax candles upon Herrick, would soon make
      him forget his love of &ldquo;Nature and Nature&rsquo;s children.&rdquo; She even saw
      herself there, and this may have made her exhibit more interest in
      Herrick&rsquo;s experiment than she really felt. In any event, Herrick found her
      most sympathetic&rsquo; and when dinner was over carried her off to a corner of
      the terrace. It was a warm night in early October, and the great woods of
      the game preserve that stretched below them were lit with a full moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way to the lake for a moonlight row with one of the house party who
      belonged to that sex that does not row, but looks well in the moon-light,
      Kelly halted, and jeered mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you sit there,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;while those poor beasts are
      freezing in a cave, with not even a silk coverlet or a pillow-sham. You
      and your valet ought to be down there now carrying them pajamas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kelly,&rdquo; declared Herrick, unruffled in his moment of triumph, &ldquo;I hate to
      say, &lsquo;I told you so,&rsquo; but you force me. Go away,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;You have
      neither imagination nor soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he assured Miss Waring, as Kelly and his companion left
      them. &ldquo;Now, I see nothing in what I accomplished that is ridiculous. Had
      you watched those bears as I did, you would have felt that sympathy that
      exists between all who love the out-of-door life. A dog loves to see his
      master pick up his stick and his hat to take him for a walk, and the man
      enjoys seeing the dog leaping and quartering the fields before him. They
      are both the happier. At least I am happier to-night, knowing those bears
      are at peace and at home, than I would be if I thought of them being
      whipped through their tricks in a dirty theatre.&rdquo; Herrick pointed to the
      great forest trees of the preserve, their tops showing dimly in the mist
      of moonlight. &ldquo;Somewhere, down in that valley,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;are three
      happy animals. They are no longer slaves and puppets&mdash;they are their
      own masters. For the rest of their lives they can sleep on pine needles
      and dine on nuts and honey. No one shall molest them, no one shall force
      them through degrading tricks. Hereafter they can choose their life, and
      their own home among the rocks, and the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Herrick&rsquo;s words
      were frozen on his tongue. From the other end of the terrace came a scream
      so fierce, so long, so full of human suffering, that at the sound the
      blood of all that heard it turned to water. It was so appalling that for
      an instant no one moved, and then from every part of the house, along the
      garden walks, from the servants&rsquo; quarters, came the sound of pounding
      feet. Herrick, with Miss Waring clutching at his sleeve, raced toward the
      other end of the terrace. They had not far to go. Directly in front of
      them they saw what had dragged from the very soul of the woman the scream
      of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing-room opened upon the terrace, and, seated at the piano,
      Jackson had been playing for those in the room to dance. The windows to
      the terrace were open. The terrace itself was flooded with moonlight.
      Seeking the fresh air, one of the dancers stepped from the drawing-room to
      the flags outside. She had then raised the cry of terror and fallen in a
      faint. What she had seen, Herrick a moment later also saw. On the terrace
      in the moon-light, Bruno and Clara, on their hind legs, were solemnly
      waltzing. Neither the scream nor the cessation of the music disturbed
      them. Contentedly, proudly, they continued to revolve in hops and leaps.
      From their happy expression, it was evident they not only were enjoying
      themselves, but that they felt they were greatly affording immeasurable
      delight to others. Sick at heart, furious, bitterly hurt, with roars of
      mocking laughter in his ears, Herrick ran toward the stables for help. At
      the farther end of the terrace the butler had placed a tray of liqueurs,
      whiskeys, and soda bottles. His back had been turned for only a few
      moments, but the time had sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lolling with his legs out, stretched in a wicker chair, Herrick beheld the
      form of Ikey. Between his uplifted paws he held aloof the base of a
      decanter; between his teeth, and well jammed down his throat, was the long
      neck of the bottle. From it issued the sound of gentle gurgling. Herrick
      seized the decanter and hurled it crashing upon the terrace. With
      difficulty Ikey rose. Swaying and shaking his head reproachfully, he gave
      Herrick a perfectly accurate imitation of an intoxicated bear.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
